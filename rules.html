<center><h2>General Rules</h2></center>
<center><p><b>It is the responsibility of the Feedol member to read and fully understand these rules and policies before participating in any  game(i.e. head to head games , cups, tournaments e.t.c.) hosted by Feedol. These rules apply to all matches.
</p></b></center>
<center><p>For head-to-head matches with entries between £3 and £10 there is a £1 service fee. Matches beetween £10 and £50 have a 2 pound  service fee, while there is a 10% service fee for head-to-head matches played above $50. All multiplayer console, PC and arcade tournaments have set entries and set prizes. Service fees help the us operate smoothly and offer big money tournaments, bonuses, and other rewards.

All multiplayer console, PC and arcade tournaments have set entries and set prizes. Service fees help the us operate smoothly and offer big money tournaments, bonuses, and other rewards.
</p></center>
<center><p>From the moment the first member reports the results of the match the other participant has 30 minutes hour to verify or dispute those results. If the results are not verified or disputed the system will automatically verify the report 30 minutes after it is made. For multiplayer tournaments if the results are not verified or disputed by the second party within 3 hours of the report the system will automatically verify the results. Should a match go unreported within one hour of it being accepted, it will be considered null and void. It will not be added to the players' profiles and the monies will be returned to the users' accounts. If you cancel a match or a match is canceled it is final. Once a match is wiped it can not be brought back up.
</p><center>
<center><p>if there is a draw in a head to head match make you should restart the match until there is a winner </p></center>
<center><p>c If there is a draw In a match where there is a draw in a head to head mat</p></center>
<center><p>If you want to create  your own set of rules and game play settings, they must be documented in the Pre Game Comments of each match. Any rule not stated in the comments section will be considered invalid and not an enforceable rule for the match. All rules agreed upon in the Pre Game comments are binding. All agreed upon rules apply to both parties unless the agreed upon rules specifically state otherwise. Any rule that does not pertain to game play for the match in question is not an enforceable rule. Glitches that manipulate the basic functions of the game itself are enforceable whether the glitch is specified in the agreed upon rules as disallowed or not.
</p><center>
<center><p>Custom rosters and custom players are not allowed unless agreed upon under the game play settings and Pre Game Comments. If you customize the standard online rosters in any way it can result in an unfavorable decision. If you customize your rosters in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage without an agreement or acknowledgement by both players pre game it will result in a forfeit. If you are caught doing this , you will get 5 red lights , If you are cited for doing it more than once without an agreement or acknowledgment by both parties pre game we shall terminate your account. </p><center>
<center><p>Unless it is in the pre game rules or acknowledged on the site by both parties prior to gameplay all challenges are 1v1. Guests are not allowed.
</p><center>

<center><p>We understand that some games lag and that it is not ideal for game play. That being said unless the game is exited immediately or at a point that we deem there to be no advantage for either party and evidence is provided of the claimed lag the game will have to be played out. We have no grounds to take a lead or win off the board when both players are playing at the same disadvantage. If someone is found to be intentionally lagging it will result in an automatic loss.
</p><center>
<center><p>For any point spread to be valid it needs to be acknowledged ON THE SITE by both parties prior to initiating the challenge or in the person giving the points rules. All agreed upon point spreads will be added on to the final score upon completion of regulation unless the rules state otherwise. If a rule is broken and the game is exited immediately the points are added on at that time.
</p><center>

<center><h2>Disputes</h2></center>

<center><p>Disputes can only be initiated when reporting the results of a match, you can file a dispute under my matches on the my saloon page. Anytime a rule is claimed to have been violated evidence is required to back that claim or it will be considered invalid. 
</p></center>
<center><p>Any rule claimed to be broken based on settings, that can be viewed by both players pre game, such as amount of time per quarter or period, skill level, rosters, injured players, disallowed teams, who is supposed to be home team, jersey color, weather, game title, whatever it may be can be considered invalid per review based on the amount of time played and score. Any claimed broken rule based on settings that can be viewed pre game in a match played more than 25% through will be automatically invalid regardless of score. If you wait until your opponent has an advantage to exit and make a claim regarding settings, your claim will be considered invalid. If you do not agree with the settings or team being used do not start the game. 
</p></center>
<center><p>There are no forfeit wins on Gamersaloon in 1v1 matches nor is there any reason to claim a win in an a game that has not begun. Claiming a win in an unplayed 1v1 match will result in a dispute on your profile and will result in a fine up to the full amount of the match.
</p></center>
<center><p>If you intentionally exit a match while losing or the game is tied and provide no valid evidence that would give you grounds to exit the match you will concede the remaining time. Depending on circumstance if you intentionally exit a game while winning you may also concede the remaining time.
</p></center>
<center><p>If you claim a win in a game you are losing or lost and provide nothing that would give you grounds to do so it will result in an automatic forfeit. </p></center>
<center><p>Claiming a win while in game and the outcome still in the balance can result in an unfavorable decision. If the game is played to a point where we deem the game to be in hand the score is what will be enforced. If your opponent claims a win while in game, you procure evidence to that effect, and continue to play past that point your claim will automatically be considered invalid.
</p></center>
<center><p>Providing inaccurate information or evidence in an attempt to mislead Gamersaloon in a dispute review will result in a 2 red lights and a suspension.
</p></center>
<center><p>All disputes will be resolved within 24 hours. All decisions rendered by the Feedol staff are binding. If you would like to have your case reviewed  you can appeal but you must provide indisputable evidence to back your claim or else you get 3 red lights.
</p></center>
<center><p>If a player proves a rule to be broken by their opponent at a point where they are winning the match, the match is tied, or it is a one possession, one run, one goal game and the match is exited immediately the player who broke the rule will concede the remaining time and lose the match.
</p></center>
<center><p>If the match is played past the point the rule was violated and the evidence is sent in the match will be considered a draw and all money will be returned to the participants less the Feedol fee unless the evidence provided shows the broken rule had a direct effect on the final score.
</p></center>
<center><p>If you violate an agreed upon rule you will be given a dispute on your profile and reprimanded at discretion.
</p></center>
<center><h2>Diconnections</h2></center>
<center><p>It is the responsibility of the Feedol member to read and fully understand these rules and policies before participating in any tournaments. These rules apply to all matches. 
</p></center>
<center><p>Regardless of whose  end the game disconnects on site policy in the event of a disconnection is to finish the game by starting a new game, adding the score of the game prior to disconnection to the end of the remaining time played, recreating the circumstance at the point of disconnection as best as possible, and playing out the remaining time. 
</p></center>
<center><p>Players are expected to exit the match when the remaining time has been played out. If the game is not exited once the remaining time has passed any time played is valid to the final score. All point spreads will be added on to the final score upon completion of regulation unless the rules state otherwise or you and your opponent agree to something different and that agreement can be verified. If the portion of the game played is not to the end of a quarter or period it will be subject to review by the Beta Team.
</p></center>
<center><p>Details and circumstances of how the game will be completed need to be worked out prior to playing out the remaining time. If you and your opponent start a new game with the intent to play the remaining time out and you have an issue with teams, who has the ball, spot of the ball, down and distance, player injuries, pitcher being used, game settings, the clock, amount of timeouts, teams, whatever it may be you are expected to procure evidence and exit the match immediately. If you continue and play the game out your claim will be considered invalid. Any action taken that is deemed to be done with the intention to violate the disconnection policy will result in a forfeit if you were losing the match at the time the game disconnected.
</p></center>
<center><p>Refusal to follow the disconnection policy in a game that is tied or you are losing with no grounds to do so will result in forfeiture of the remaining time. Refusal to follow the disconnection policy in a game that you are winning with no grounds to do so can also result in an unfavorable decision. We have no grounds to force your opponent to complete a match at a later date or time. If you are uncooperative, unresponsive, or unable to complete a match that you are losing, is tied, or one possession, within a reasonable amount of time(any more then 5-10 minutes) it will result in a forfeit. If you are uncooperative, unresponsive, or unable to complete a match that you are winning by more then one possession, within a reasonable amount of time(any more then 5-10 minutes), it can result in an unfavorable decision. 
</p></center>
<center><p>Feedol  reserves the right to forfeit someone from the remaining time in the event of a disconnection if the score and/or circumstances dictate the remaining time need not be played or the situation can not be recreated.</p></center>
<center><p>If a player is kicked out for "excessive grieving" you treat it as a disconnection unless evidence can be provided to show it should be enforced differently. If you are kicked out for excessive grieving more then once in a match you are losing you will forfeit the remaining time. If you are kicked out for excessive grieving more then once in a game you are winning it can result in an unfavorable decision. 
</p></center>

<center><h2>Recommended rules</h2></center>
<center><p>Feedol rules are something that are often used by users for 1v1 matches. Feedol rules are a suggested rule set and do not automatically apply to 1v1 tournaments. They must be in the pregame comments for it to be an enforceable rule set. Below is a list of our suggested rules for some of the more popular games played on Feedol</p></center>
<center><b><p>MADDEN</p></b></center>
<center><p>Lowest Ranked Team in the game is the home team.
</p></center>
<center><p>No blocking kicks or punts. If a FG or PAT is blocked those points count toward the final score, the points are added at the end of regulation.
</p></center>
<center><p>No faking punts, FGs or PATs If the ball is turned over the rule is void. If the fake is on a PAT any points procured do not count.
</p></center>
<center><p>No onside kick until the 4th quarter and losing, if the ball is not recovered by the kicking team the rule is void,
</p></center>
<center><p>If evidence is provided that shows a player did an action to avoid a challenge they will automatically forfeit. We have to see the play and the action resulting in the challenge being disabled, without it we have nothing to enforce.
</p></center>
<center><p>If evidence is provided that shows a player paused the game with the sole intention of manipulating the in game play to gain a competitive advantage they would not have otherwise had it will result in an automatic forfeit. 
</p></center>
<center><p>No manually rushing the A or B gap. If the player you are controlling is more then 2 yards off the line of scrimmage at the snap of the ball it is considered legal.
</p></center>
<center><p>No manually rushing the A or B gap. If the player you are controlling is more then 2 yards off the line of scrimmage at the snap of the ball it is considered legal.
</p></center>
<center><p>Unless the rules specifically state otherwise the even teams feature is off. If even teams is on it needs to be in the pre game rules or acknowledged on the site prior to playing by both players. 
</p></center>
<center><p>Unless the rules specifically state otherwise Chew clock is legal. If chew clock is against the rules we will only enforce someone selecting the chew clock option as a broken rule. If you want running the play clock down manually each play to violate the rules it needs to be specified. 
</p></center>
<center><p>If no custom playbook is in the agreed upon rules we need outright proof the person used a custom playbook or in game evidence showing us two plays were ran that are not in the same playbook. If no custom playbook is in the rules but it is proven that the person that used one showed his opponent his playbook pre game, or made his opponent aware that he was going to use one, and the opponent proceeds to play anyway the claim will be considered invalid. </p></center>
<center><p>Nano blitzes are legal unless the agreed upon rules state otherwise. A nano blitz in some way shape or form requires setting up and/or adjusting the defense in a way that tricks the offensive line to abandoning their blocking assignment at the snap of the ball and the adjustments resulting in immediate pressure. 
</p></center>
<center><b><p>FIFA</p></b></center>
<center><p>Draw = Restart.</p></center>
<center><p>No time wasting. You cannot kick or hold the ball along your back line for more than 3 minutes(game time).</p></center>
<center><p>No custom set pieces. 
</p></center>
<center><b><p>Fifa Ultimate Team</p></b></center>
<center><p>No time wasting. You can not kick or hold the ball along your back line for more than 3 minutes(game time)
</p></center>
<center><p>No substitutions.</p></center>
<center><p>No custom set pieces.</p></center>
<center><p>No attribute cards.</p></center>
<center><p>Draw = Restart.</p></center>

<center><b><p>NBA 2K</p></b></center>
<center><p>No Manual Cherry Picking. If a user controlled offensive player is advanced or already past half court with no defenders between them and the basket they are shooting on prior to their team having the ball we will consider that a cherry pick. In order to enforce this rule we have to see where the player is up court the moment the ball is procured.</p></center>
<center><p>No pump faking multiple times to draw a foul from a computer controlled defender.
</p></center>
<center><p>If your pause timer runs out when you are losing a match or the game is tied you automatically lose. If a pause timer runs out when you are winning a match the match will be deemed unresolved. Both rules are void if the pause timer running out is due to someone capturing a replay to send in as evidence and they send it in. The evidence has to be valid evidence in order to void the rule. This rule is only enforceable if the photo is taken stating your opponents pause timer has run out and you exit immediately, if you play past the point the pause timer runs out your claim will be considered invalid. Whether Feedol rules are part of your rule set or not if your pause timer runs out more then once we will enforce this rule. If Feedol rules are not part of the rule set and your opponents pause timer runs out once we have no grounds to enforce it.
</p></center>
<center><p>No playbook and no editing playbook are two different things and enforced differently. If the rules state no playbook or no running plays any play ran will violate the rules, this includes quick plays. If your rule set disallows running plays and the play in question involves a screen what you provide needs to indisputably prove it was a play that was ran. If the rules state no editing playbook any play ran not in the teams playbook will violate the rules.

<center><b><p>PS3 or Xbox </p></b></center>
<center><p>Step 1: Have your recording device ready.</p></center>
<center><p>
If you are not recording your game play on PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 you will want to make sure you procure the proper evidence. most users will have a device such as a phone or tablet capable of recording small video clips and taking photos, you want to use that to your advantage.

If you are not recording your game play on PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 you will want to make sure you procure the proper evidence. most users will have a device such as a phone or tablet capable of recording small video clips and taking photos, you want to use that to your advantage.
</p></center>
<center><p>Step 2: Start up evidence.</p></center>
<center><p>You want to take a small video of the team select screen showing the gamer tags or personas and teams being used then go to the PS3 or Xbox dashboard by clicking the middle button and show us the player they are currently playing.</p></center>
<center><p>Step 3: End game evidence.</p></center>
<center><p>Upon completion of the match or when the match disconnects you will want to show us the final box score or disconnection screen then go to the PS3 or Xbox dashboard by clicking the middle button and show us the player they are currently playing.

</p></center>
<center><p>Procuring those two videos will put you in a position where you have the necessary evidence to back an claim involving almost anything other then the claim of an in game rule being violated. In the event you are claiming an in game rule was violated essentially all games are going to allow you to view replays. Use the replays, procure a video of the play in question.
</p></center>
<center><p>You can either upload the videos to youtube and either copy and paste the URL in the dispute comments or send it via email to Beta@Feedol.</p></center>
