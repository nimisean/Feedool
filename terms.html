<center><p>Collusion occurs when two or more Users attempt to gain an unfair advantage by sharing knowledge of the Skill Challenges or other information to other Users' disadvantage. Any User who attempts to collude or colludes with any other User while using the Service may be permanently banned from using the Service and their Account may be terminated immediately. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate complaints registered against Users suspected of collusion. If the Company is informed during play about suspected collusive behavior, it may, in its sole discretion, terminate suspected Users' access to the Service and/or block their Accounts. However, under no circumstances shall the Company be liable for any loss, whatsoever, sustained by You as a result of the collusive, or otherwise unlawful activity of any person using the Service and no User shall have the right to require the Company to take any other steps against Users suspected of collusion, cheating or any other form of fraud.
</p></center>
<center><p>Abuse</p></center>
<center><p>By entering into this Agreement, You agree that You will not use any technique other than pure skill during a Skill Challenge. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, establishing multiple Accounts, the use of program codes or commands or any adapted hardware or software to assist play, the impersonation of another User or Account, or deliberately losing games for the purpose of getting a competitive advantage. For a more exhaustive discussion of prohibited techniques, refer to the Skill Challenge Rules located at http://www.Feedol.com/Rules.php.</p></center>
<center><p>FEEDBACK/REVIEW SYSTEM</p></center>
<center><p>
Under this Agreement, You accept and understand that You and Your Account will be subject to feedback and reviews submitted by Skill Challenge Entrants from Your previous Skill Challenges. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Material" and "Content" when used in relation to material and content posted by a User shall include any type of Material or Content, including without limitation, verbal, audio and visual</p></center>
<center><p>The Site provides a forum for Skill Challenge Entrants to post Material, such as comments, feedback or ratings to rate any previous adversaries that they have challenged, including their subjective rating of their ability. Upon completion of a Skill Challenge, each Skill Challenge Entrant will have the opportunity to submit publicly available feedback relating to the Skill Challenge and their opponent.

</p></center>
<center><p>Feedol will remove feedback ratings and comments:</p></center>
<center><p>if such Material violates the terms of this Agreement, and Feedol receives satisfactory notification of the same;</p></center>
<center><p>upon mutual agreement of each User; or
</p></center>
<center><p>if Feedol is legally obligated by court order or Judgment, or pursuant to a settlement agreement resolving a lawsuit.</p></center>
<center><p>Users should use caution and good judgment when submitting feedback or ratings for another User, because:</p></center>
<center><p>
Feedback or ratings cannot be edited or removed once they have been submitted. Feedback and ratings generally become a permanent part of a User's record and are publicly viewable.
</p></center>
<center><p>Users can be held legally responsible for damages to another User's reputation if a court were to find that the feedback or ratings constitute libel or defamation. Under federal law (the Communications Decency Act) because Feedol does not censor feedback or ratings or investigate them for accuracy, Feedol is not legally responsible for the feedback or ratings that are posted on the Site, even if the feedback or ratings are defamatory. However, this Communications Decency Act does not protect any person who leaves feedback or ratings from liability.</p></center>
<center><p>Feedback or ratings that violate the terms of this Agreement, or that meet any of the circumstances described below or in the Abuse portion of Section 20, may be subject to removal.</p></center>
<center><p>Feedol is provided with a valid court order finding that the disputed feedback or ratings are slanderous, libelous, defamatory or otherwise illegal.
The feedback or ratings contain profane, vulgar, obscene, or racist language or adult Material. Inflammatory language, such as "fraud, liar, cheater, scam artist, con man" etc., while strongly discouraged, will not be removed.
The feedback or rating contains personal identifying information about another User, including real name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.
The feedback or rating makes reference to law enforcement organization investigation.
The feedback or rating contains links or scripts.
Feedback or ratings posted or submitted by a User who provided Feedol with false contact information and could not be contacted.
Feedback or ratings posted or submitted by Users who are indefinitely suspended for certain policy violations within 90 days of registration. Feedol believes that Users who are indefinitely suspended soon after registration shouldn't be able to permanently impact another Account.
Feedol will automatically remove feedback from Users indefinitely suspended within 90 days of registration. Not all suspension types qualify for automatic feedback removal.
Violations of these provisions may result in a range of actions, including without limitation, Account termination, limits on Account privileges, Account suspension and/or feedback or rating removal. Negative feedback or ratings intended for another User will be considered for removal only in situations where the User responsible for the mistaken posting informs Feedol of the error and has already placed the same feedback for the correct User.

</p></center>
<center><p>CHAT SYSTEM</p></center>
<center><p>The Site provides a chat forum for Users to connect and chat (the "Chat System"). Users wishing to post Material on the Chat System must strictly adhere to the policies outlined herein.</p></center>
<center><p>Any violation of these provisions may result in a range of actions, including without limitation, Account termination, fines, limits on Account privileges, and/or Account suspension.</p></center>
<center><p>DISCLOSURES</p></center>
<center><p>Odds of Winning</p></center>
<center><p>You recognize and understand that the outcomes of Skill Challenges are directly related to the skill level of the Skill Challenge Entrants, and are fully outside of control of Feedol. It is impossible for Feedol to assess Your odds of winning. Skill Challenge Entrants are solely responsible for determining the Skill Challenges in which they enter and participate through use of the Site.</p></center>
<center><p>Verified Winner Determination</p></center>
<center><p>Skill Challenge Entrants are responsible for managing and reporting the Skill Challenge Results to determine the Verified Winner. As outlined in Section 4, Feedol may act as a third-party arbiter for Disputed Results to determine a Verified Winner and award a Prize, or if not, convert the Accepted Skill Challenge to a Canceled Accepted Skill Challenge.</p></center>
<center><p>WE DISCLAIM ALL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU</p></center>
<center><p>Feedol has no obligation to check whether Users are using the Site Services in accordance with this Agreement or any other agreement.Under no circumstances shall Feedol be obligated to investigate or pursue any complaints made by a User against any other User using the Site or Services or to take any other action in connection therewith, or take any action against a User for any reason, including without limitation, for violating the terms of this Agreement. Feedol may, in its sole discretion, decide to take appropriate action against any person it suspects to be engaging in any unlawful activity or otherwise violating the terms of this Agreement, but is under no obligation to do so.You will not be entitled to a refund from the Company for any sums You believe to be owed to You as a result of any other User's misconduct, unlawful behavior or otherwise, whether or not the Company pursues any action against such User. It is Your sole responsibility to resolve such issues without involving Feedol.</p></center>
<center><p>
RELEASE
</p></center>
<center><p>If You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If You are a California resident, You acknowledge and waive the effect of California Civil Code 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

</p></center>
<center><p>Note: Some states, countries, provinces and/or localities do not allow for limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so the above limitation may not apply to You.In the event that You have any right, claim or action against any other User arising from the User's use of the Site, You agree to pursue such right, claim or action independently of and without recourse to Us, and You release and agree to hold Us harmless from and against any and all claims, liability, damages, losses, costs and expenses including legal fees known and unknown, arising from or in any way connected with such right, claim or action.We shall not be liable for any acts or omissions made by any Internet Service Provider ("ISP") with whom Users have contracted to gain access to the server that hosts the Site.</p></center>

For every subsequent thirty (30) consecutive days of inactivity, a $10.00 (US) administrative charge will be deducted from Your Account.
</p></center>
<center><p>You can avoid Termination and the Termination fee that may arise from latency by notifying Us, in writing, before the foregoing sixty (60) day latency occurs. Written notification under this section should be directed to latent@Feedol.</p></center>
