<center><p>You have right to refrain from giving us certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of all of our features. We use the information that you provide for to enhance the service, such as responding to your requests. However, you may not mask your identity by providing false or misleading information.

<center><p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide enhanced features such as personalized greetings, suggestions and storage of personal information between visits.

<center><p>All web browsers have the ability to accept cookies, reject cookies, or to prompt the user before accepting them. The help portion of the toolbar of your browser will tell you how to select the option that suits you best. However, disabling the acceptance of cookies allows you to take full advantage of some of the best and most advanced features that we have to offer, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

<center><p>Feedol lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Feedol's cookies.
</p></center>
<center><p>Feedol uses web beacons to access Feedol cookies inside and outside our network of websites and in connection with Feedol products and services.</p></center>
<center><p>The information that we collect about our customers is critical to our business. We respect and value this information, and do not want to jeopardize the flow of information between our users and the Site. Therefore, we are not in the business of selling this information to other websites or businesses. There are very limited circumstances where we do share some customer information, and this is outlined immediately below. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Feedol, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
</p></center>
<center><p>Due to the size and complexity of our operation, it is necessary to employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Agents are often used to assist with verifications, fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These agents have access to only the personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not use it for other purposes.
</p></center>
<center><p>Occasionally we send offers to selected groups of Feedol customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please log into your account and adjust your contact preferences. To take full advantage of the site and the tremendous savings offered, we recommend that you choose to receive these offers</p></center>
<center><p>To improve the offerings and selection at our website, we occasionally acquire as we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that XEDEX  LIMITED , or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
</p></center>
<center><p>It is sometimes necessary to release account and other personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Feedol, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Under no circumstances, however, does this include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this privacy policy.
</p></center>

</p></center>
<center><p>Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
